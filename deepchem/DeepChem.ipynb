It begins with the label \"DiskDataset\". Dataset is an abstract class. It has a few subclasses that correspond to different ways of storing data.\n","- DiskDataset is a dataset that has been saved to disk. The data is stored in a way that can be efficiently accessed, even if the total amount of data is far larger than your computer's memory.\n","- NumpyDataset is an in-memory dataset that holds all the data in NumPy arrays. It is a useful tool when manipulating small to medium sized datasets that can fit entirely in memory.\n","- ImageDataset is a more specialized class that stores some or all of the data in image files on disk. It is useful when working with models that have images as their inputs or outputs.\n","\n","Now let's consider the contents of the Dataset. Every Dataset stores a list of samples. Very roughly speaking, a sample is a single data point. In this case, each sample is a molecule. In other datasets a sample might correspond to an experimental assay, a cell line, an image, or many other things. For every sample the dataset stores the following information.\n","\n","- The features, referred to as X. This is the input that should be fed into a model to represent the sample.\n","- The labels, referred to as y. This is the desired output from the model. During training, it tries to make the model's output for each sample as close as possible to y.\n","- The weights, referred to as w. This can be used to indicate that some data values are more important than others. In later tutorials we will see examples of how this is useful.\n","- An ID, which is a unique identifier for the sample. This can be anything as long as it is unique. Sometimes it is just an integer index, but in this dataset the ID is a SMILES string describing the molecule.\n","Notice that X, y, and w all have 113 as the size of their first dimension. That means this dataset contains 113 samples.\n","\n","The final piece of information listed in the output is task_names. Some datasets contain multiple pieces of information for each sample.

A fingerprint is a fixed length array, where different elements indicate the presence of different features in the molecule.

They also are sometimes called \"circular fingerprints\". The ECFP algorithm begins by classifying atoms based only on their direct properties and bonds. Each unique pattern is a feature. For example, \"carbon atom bonded to two hydrogens and two heavy atoms\" would be a feature, and a particular element of the fingerprint is set to 1 for any molecule that contains that feature. It then iteratively identifies new features by looking at larger circular neighborhoods. One specific feature bonded to two other specific features becomes a higher level feature, and the corresponding element is set for any molecule that contains it.

The input is a grid of pixels. There is a vector of data values for each pixel, for e.g. RGB channels. The data passes through a series of convolutional layers. Each layer combines the data from a pixel and its neighbors to produce a new data vector for the pixel. Early layers detect small scale local patterns, while later layers detect larger, more abstract patterns. Often the convolutional layers alternate w/ pooling layers that perform some operation such as max or min over local regions.\n","\n","Graph convolutions are similar, but they operate on a graph. They begin with a data vector for each node of the graph (for e.g. the chemical properties of the atom that node represents). Convolutional and pooling layers combine information from connected nodes(for e.g. atoms that are bonded to each other) to produce a new data vector for each node\n","\n","### Training a GraphConvModel"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ra2OpVv03eP-"},"source":["tasks, datasets, transformers = dc.molnet.load_tox21(featurizer='GraphConv')\n","train_dataset, valid_dataset, test_dataset = datasets"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"agcf1DJ-5EzF","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1634636124642,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":163428,"user":{"displayName":"Indrik Wijaya","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"00208067985282844199"}},"outputId":"e2d6e3a9-d861-4022-ecff-8cc417ddd3bf"},"source":["n_tasks = len(tasks)\n","model = dc.models.GraphConvModel(n_tasks, mode='classification')\n","model.fit(train_dataset, nb_epoch=50)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/indexed_slices.py:449: UserWarning: Converting sparse IndexedSlices(IndexedSlices(indices=Tensor(\"gradient_tape/private__graph_conv_keras_model_1/graph_pool_3/Reshape_14:0\", shape=(438,), dtype=int32), values=Tensor(\"gradient_tape/private__graph_conv_keras_model_1/graph_pool_3/Reshape_13:0\", shape=(438, 64), dtype=float32), dense_shape=Tensor(\"gradient_tape/private__graph_conv_keras_model_1/graph_pool_3/Cast_4:0\", shape=(2,), dtype=int32))) to a dense Tensor of unknown shape.

Graph convolutions are a special case of a large class of architectures that represent molecules as graphs. They work in similar ways but vary in the details. For example, they may associate data vectors with the atoms, the bonds connecting them, or both. They may use a variety of techniques to calculate new data vectors from those in the previous layer, and a variety of techniques to compute molecule level properties at the end.\n","\n","DeepChem supports lots of different graph based models. Some of them require molecules to be featurized in slightly different ways. Because of this, there are two other featurizers called WeaveFeaturizer and MolGraphConvFeaturizer. They each convert molecules into a different type of Python object that is used by particular models. When using any graph based model, just check the documentation to see what featurizer you need to use with it.\n","\n","### CoulombMatrix\n","When working w/ flexible molecules, you may also want to consider the different conformations the molecule can take on. For example, when a drug molecule binds to a protein, the strength of the binding depends on specific interactions between pairs of atoms. To predict binding strength, you probably want to consider a variety of possible conformations and use a model that takes them into account when making predictions.\n","\n","The Coulomb matrix is one popular featurization for molecular conformations. Recall that the electrostatic Coulomb interaction between two charges is proportional to $q_1 q_2/r$ where $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the charges and $r$ is the distance between them. For a molecule with $N$ atoms, the Coulomb matrix is a $N \\times N$ matrix where each element gives the strength of the electrostatic interaction between two atoms. It contains information both about the charges on the atoms and the distances between them. More information on the functional forms used can be found [here](https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.058301).\n","\n","To apply this featurizer, we first need a set of conformations for the molecule. We can use the ConformerGenerator class to do this. It takes a RDKit molecule, generates a set of energy minimized conformers, and prunes the set to only include ones that are significantly different from each other. Let's try running it for propane."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"GzXjPxwVutzt","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1634700336007,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":969,"user":{"displayName":"Indrik Wijaya","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"00208067985282844199"}},"outputId":"f6b2b465-c7c5-4dac-d79f-d7e2421af5f4"},"source":["from rdkit import Chem\n","\n","generator = dc.utils.ConformerGenerator(max_conformers=5)\n","propane_mol = generator.generate_conformers(Chem.MolFromSmiles('CCC'))\n","print('Number of available conformers for propane: ', len(propane_mol.GetConformers()))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Number of available conformers for propane:  1\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"r868y49Xu5N7"},"source":["It only found a single conformer.

Respecting symmetries like this makes learning easier. Rotating a molecule does not change its physical properties. If the featurization does change, then the model is forced to learn that rotations are not important, but if the featurization is invariant then the model gets this property automatically.\n","\n","Coulomb matrices are not invariant under another important symmetry: permutations of the atoms' indices. A molecule's physical properties do not depend on which atom we call 'atom 1', but the Coulomb matrix does. To deal with this, the CoulumbMatrixEig featurizer was introduced, which uses the eigenvalue spectrum of the Coulumb matrix and is invariant to random permutations of the atom's indices. The disadvantage of this featurization is that it contains much less information ($N$ eigenvalues instead of an $N \\times N$ matrix), so models will be more limited in what they can learn.\n","\n","CoulombMatrixEig inherits from CoulombMatrix and featurizes a molecule by first computing the Coulomb matrices for different conformers of the molecule and then computing the eigenvalues for each Coulomb matrix.

Splitters\n","In DeepChem, a method of splitting samples into multiple datasets is defined by a Splitter object. Choosing an appropriate method for your data is very important. Otherwise, your trained model may seem to work much better than it really does.\n","\n","Consider a typical drug development pipeline. You might begin by screening many thousands of molecules to see if they bind to your target of interest. Once you find one that seems to work, you try to optimize it by testing thousands of minor variations on it, looking for one that binds more strongly. Then perhaps you test it in animals and find it has unacceptable toxicity, so you try more variations to fix the problems.\n","\n","This has an important consequence for chemical datasets: they often include lots of molecules that are very similar to each other. If you split the data into training and test sets in a naive way, the training set will include many molecules that are very similar to the ones in the test set, even if they are not exactly identical. As a result, the model may do very well on the test set, but then fail badly when you try to use it on other data that is less similar to the training data.\n","\n","- RandomSplitter: This is one of the simplest splitters. It just selects samples for the training, validation, and test sets in a completely random way.\n","Didn't we just say that's a bad idea? Well, it depends on your data. If every sample is truly independent of every other, then this is just as good a way as any to split the data. There is no universally best choice of splitter. It all depends on your particular dataset, and for some datasets this is a fine choice.\n","- RandomStratifiedSplitter: Some datasets are very unbalanced: only a tiny fraction of all samples are positive. In that case, random splitting may sometimes lead to the validation or test set having few or even no positive samples for some tasks. That makes it unable to evaluate performance.\n","RandomStratifiedSplitter addresses this by dividing up the positive and negative samples evenly. If you ask for a 80/10/10 split, the validation and test sets will contain not just 10% of samples, but also 10% of the positive samples for each task.\n","- ScaffoldSplitter: This splitter tries to address the problem discussed above where many molecules are very similar to each other. It identifies the scaffold that forms the core of each molecule, and ensures that all molecules with the same scaffold are put into the same dataset. This is still not a perfect solution, since two molecules may have different scaffolds but be very similar in other ways, but it usually is a large improvement over random splitting.\n","- ButinaSplitter: This is another splitter that tries to address the problem of similar molecules. It clusters them based on their molecular fingerprints, so that ones with similar fingerprints will tend to be in the same dataset. The time required by this splitting algorithm scales as the square of the number of molecules, so it is mainly useful for small to medium sized datasets.\n","- SpecifiedSplitter: This splitter leaves everything up to the user. You tell it exactly which samples to put in each dataset. This is useful when you know in advance that a particular splitting is appropriate for your data.\n","An example is temporal splitting. Consider a research project where you are continually generating and testing new molecules. As you gain more data, you periodically retrain your model on the steadily growing dataset, then use it to predict results for other not yet tested molecules. A good way of validating whether this works is to pick a particular cutoff date, train the model on all data you had at that time, and see how well it predicts other data that was generated later.\n","\n","### Effect of using different Splitters"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"fVoyEUDDxm9K","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1634701380345,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":218510,"user":{"displayName":"Indrik Wijaya","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"00208067985282844199"}},"outputId":"117210ea-3876-4ee6-ab36-5ff97d7c4931"},"source":["splitters = ['random', 'scaffold', 'butina']\n","metric = dc.metrics.Metric(dc.metrics.roc_auc_score)\n","for splitter in splitters:\n","  tasks, datasets, transformers = dc.molnet.load_tox21(featurizer='ECFP', split=splitter)\n","  train_dataset, valid_dataset, test_dataset = datasets\n","  model = dc.models.MultitaskClassifier(n_tasks = len(tasks), n_features = 1024, layer_sizes=[1000])\n","  model.fit(train_dataset, nb_epoch=10)\n","  print('splitter:', splitter)\n","  print('Training set score:', model.evaluate(train_dataset, [metric], transformers))\n","  print('Test set score:', model.evaluate(test_dataset, [metric], transformers))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["'split' is deprecated.

Using two layers with the larger learning rate doesn't work very well. It seems the deeper model requires a smaller learning rate. We also see that 20% dropout usually works better than 50%. Once we narrow down the list of models based on these observations, all the validation scores are very close to each other, probably close enough that the remaining variation is mainly noise. It doesn't seem to make much difference which of the remaining hyperparameter sets we use, so let's arbitrarily pick a single layer of width 1000 and learning rate of 0.0001.\n","\n","### Early Stopping\n","There is one other important hyperparameter we haven't considered yet: how long we train the model for.  GridHyperparamOpt trains each for a fixed, fairly small number of epochs. That isn't necessarily the best number.\n","\n","You might expect that the longer you train, the better your model will get, but that isn't usually true. If you train too long, the model will usually start overfitting to irrelevant details of the training set. You can tell when this happens because the validation set score stops increasing and may even decrease, while the score on the training set continues to improve.\n","\n","Fortunately, we don't need to train lots of different models for different numbers of steps to identify the optimal number. We just train it once, monitor the validation score, and keep whichever parameters maximize it. This is called \"early stopping\". DeepChem's ValidationCallback class can do this for us automatically. In the example below, we have it compute the validation set's ROC AUC every 1000 training steps. If you add the save_dir argument, it will also save a copy of the best model parameters to disk.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"9S9iMqe10rSw","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1634703151044,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":304884,"user":{"displayName":"Indrik Wijaya","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"00208067985282844199"}},"outputId":"98823acb-35a9-4af8-cf9d-338a7e3fcd27"},"source":["model = dc.models.MultitaskClassifier(n_tasks = len(tasks),\n","                                      n_features = 1024,\n","                                      layer_sizes = [1000],\n","                                      dropouts = 0.2,\n","                                      learning_rate = 0.0001)\n","callback = dc.models.ValidationCallback(valid_dataset, 1000, metric)\n","model.fit(train_dataset, nb_epoch=50, callbacks=callback)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Step 1000 validation: roc_auc_score=0.760029\n","Step 2000 validation: roc_auc_score=0.772773\n","Step 3000 validation: roc_auc_score=0.77612\n","Step 4000 validation: roc_auc_score=0.763658\n","Step 5000 validation: roc_auc_score=0.770311\n","Step 6000 validation: roc_auc_score=0.761318\n","Step 7000 validation: roc_auc_score=0.774108\n","Step 8000 validation: roc_auc_score=0.771456\n","Step 9000 validation: roc_auc_score=0.763771\n","Step 10000 validation: roc_auc_score=0.762044\n","Step 11000 validation: roc_auc_score=0.766374\n","Step 12000 validation: roc_auc_score=0.762316\n","Step 13000 validation: roc_auc_score=0.767776\n","Step 14000 validation: roc_auc_score=0.763505\n","Step 15000 validation: roc_auc_score=0.754377\n","Step 16000 validation: roc_auc_score=0.771132\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0.6714198303222656"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":15}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"K0A5ihwT04Qr"},"source":["### Learning Rate Schedules\n","In some cases it works better to vary the learning rate during training.

Goal: demonstrate how multitask methods can provide improved performance in situations w/ little or very unbalanced data\n","- The MUV dataset is a challenging benchmark in molecular design that consists of 17 different 'targets' where there are only a few 'active' compounds/target. There are 93,087 compounds in total, yet no task has more than 30 active compounds, and many have even less. Training a model with such a small number of positive examples is very challenging. Multitask models address this by training a single model that predicts all the different targets at once. If a feature is useful for predicting one task, it often is useful for predicting several other tasks as well. Each added task makes it easier to learn important features, which improves performance on [other tasks.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00146)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"tRdJNHxBpZtf","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1634716501250,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":650790,"user":{"displayName":"Indrik Wijaya","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"00208067985282844199"}},"outputId":"1ed6af6e-ca74-410f-8f96-15d8f4329ade"},"source":["tasks, datasets, transformers = dc.molnet.load_muv(split='stratified')\n","train, alid, test = datasets"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["'split' is deprecated.
